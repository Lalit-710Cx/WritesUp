These Three thing is the backbone of an CyberSecurity:

- **Confidentiality** ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
- **Integrity** aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
- **Availability** aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.
---
- **Confidentiality**: According to various laws in modern countries, healthcare providers must ensure and maintain the confidentiality of medical records. Consequently, healthcare providers can be held legally accountable if they illegally disclose their patients’ medical records.
- **Integrity**: If a patient record is accidentally or maliciously altered, it can lead to the wrong treatment being administered, which, in turn, can lead to a life-threatening situation. Hence, the system would be useless and potentially harmful without ensuring the integrity of medical records.
- **Availability**: When a patient visits a clinic to follow up on their medical condition, the system must be available. An unavailable system would mean that the medical practitioner cannot access the patient’s records and consequently won’t know if any current symptoms are related to the patient’s medical history. This situation can make the medical diagnosis more challenging and error-prone.

**Authenticity**: Authentic means not fraudulent or counterfeit. Authenticity is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source

**Utility**: Utility focuses on the usefulness of the information. For instance, a user might have lost the decryption key to access a laptop with encrypted storage. Although the user still has the laptop with its disk(s) intact, they cannot access them. In other words, although still available, the information is in a form that is not useful, i.e., of no utility.

The security of a system is attacked through one of several means. It can be via the disclosure of secret data, alteration of data, or destruction of data.

- **Disclosure** is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
- **Alteration** is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
- **Destruction/Denial** is the opposite of Availability.

- **Vulnerability**: Vulnerable means susceptible to attack or damage. In information security, a vulnerability is a weakness.
- **Threat**: A threat is a potential danger associated with this weakness or vulnerability.
- **Risk**: The risk is concerned with the likelihood of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability and the consequent impact on the business.
